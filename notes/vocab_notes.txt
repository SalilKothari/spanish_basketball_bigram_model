- Logits
    Raw, unnormalized outputs of a model, before aplpying probability functions like softmax

- Scalar Loss
    just a single number for loss
    CrossEntropyLoss gives this 

- θ
    paramters or weights of a model

- γ
    Momentum - the momentum factor, (like memory)
    Reinforcement Learning - discount factor (how much to value future rewards vs immediate rewards)
    SVM (Support Vector Machines) - hyperparameter that defines the reach of each training example in a feature space
