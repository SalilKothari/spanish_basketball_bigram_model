# spanish_basketball_bigram_model

Pulled various spanish basketball articles from the internet and parsed using BeautifulSoup. Implemented and trained a Bigram model on the text to generate next word prediction. Followed tutorial for creating Bigram model, but expanded functionality. Using a limited dataset, acheived a decent loss for a word-level bigram model. Future improvements could be trigram or other higher n-gram models, or a transformer. The outputs are quite funny.
