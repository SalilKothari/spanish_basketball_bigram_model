# Spanish Basketball Bigram Model

Pulled various spanish basketball articles from the internet and parsed using BeautifulSoup. Implemented and trained a Bigram model on the text to generate next word prediction. Followed guided lesson and made improvements and functionality expansions. Using a limited dataset, acheived a decent loss for a word-level bigram model. Future improvements could be trigram or other higher n-gram models, or a transformer. Additionally, simply expanding the dataset could lead to more improvements, as the training set was only 3 articles. The outputs are quite funny.
